##Codefiddle-ish
##Synopsis

This excercise uses JQuery JS and CSS to make a codepen/fiddle like site for personal development and practice

##Motivation

This app was created for personal practice.

##Installation

Codefiddle-ish uses the following:

JS
jQuery
CSS
HTML


To use this on your local machine, simply clone to desktop, then click on the index.html file and either drag it onto the browser URL space, or right click the file and open with your borwser of choice.

##Additional Notes
work in progress. All if fully functional and updates in real time, but with JS added, I am still finding security solutions for this site.
